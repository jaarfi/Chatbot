would like to use CHANNEL POINTS to do some fun stuff
Fun things i want to implement (also useful stuff)
    VTS:
        summersault
        headpats
        turboheadpats
        activate expressions
        activate effects
        changing physics
        DEDICATED WEBPAGE:
            pinning stuff to model
            resize props

    Spotify:
        current song
        skip song
        queue song
    OBS:
        ?Filters?
        VoiceChangers/Filters
        Move stuff around

    GPT stuff


currently NO CHANNEL POINTS until affiliate
	we're just gonna use commands in chat

locally running chatbot
    uses my account / jaarfibot
    constantly monitoring chat
    whenever it sees a command (!):
        takes that command
        if the message contains whitespace, its split
        the first part will be command, second will be param
        sends rest get

restful api
    takes command
    runs the appropriately named function in vts

NEXT STEPS:
    implement more vts functions
    properly launch rest apis on a server
    run chatbot on a server
    switch to fastapi
    HARD TODO:
        properly name all the files
    async context managers using contextlib as a module

    models need to validate the responses properly
        test with 
            models.ModelLoadData.model_validate({"modelID":"a"})
