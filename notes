currently NO CHANNEL POINTS until affiliate
	we're just gonna use commands in chat

locally running chatbot
    uses my account / jaarfibot
    constantly monitoring chat
    whenever it sees a command (!):
        takes that command
        if the message contains whitespace, its split
        the first part will be command, second will be param
        sends rest get

restful api
    takes command
    runs the appropriately named function in vts

NEXT STEPS:
    implement more vts functions
    properly launch rest apis on a server
    run chatbot on a server
    switch to fastapi
    HARD TODO:
        properly name all the files
    async context managers using contextlib as a module

    make unittests test according to Hiyori_a (neuro)
    test model size -100 to 100 in rel and abs or only in rel and 0 to 100 in abs

    pong game using your model?????

    flash in chatters color on message
    do somtehing on firstmessage
